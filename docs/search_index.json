"],["intro.html", "1 Introduction Line Breaks 1.1 Another numbered Header", " 1 Introduction Line Breaks Here is an example of how to insert an empty line between paragraphs. We do it using two blank lines… This is the paragraph that follows the empty line. Additionally, writers should investigate the impacts of different header levels (ex. First level (#) or Second level (##) or third (###)) as well as before and after figures/tables on spacing before and after the headers so we produce as professional looking documents as possible. There are idiosyncrasies with what happens for each above and below so that should be tested by building the documents in both formats (html and pdf) and viewing the output. Here is a test with a second level header with no empty line above and no empty line below. ## Header with no number {-} It negates the header… wow. If we put blank lines above the header however… 1.1 Another numbered Header No spacing or &lt;br&gt; above this line.
